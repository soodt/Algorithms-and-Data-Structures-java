/**
 * Class DoublyLinkedList: implements a *generic* Doubly Linked List.
 * @param <T> This is a type parameter. T is used as a class name in the
 * definition of this class.
 *
 * When creating a new DoublyLinkedList, T should be instantiated with an
 * actual class name that extends the class Comparable.
 * Such classes include String and Integer.
 *
 * For example to create a new DoublyLinkedList class containing String data: 
 *    DoublyLinkedList<String> myStringList = new DoublyLinkedList<String>();
 *
 * The class offers a toString() method which returns a comma-separated sting of
 * all elements in the data structure.
 * 
 * This is a bare minimum class you would need to completely implement.
 * You can add additional methods to support your code. Each method will need
 * to be tested by your jUnit tests -- for simplicity in jUnit testing
 * introduce only public methods.

     *
     * Worst-case asymptotic running time cost:   Theta(n)
     *
     * Justification:
     *  The code consists of the lines before the for-loop, the for-loop itself and the lines after the for-loop.
     *
     *  The lines before the for loop involve 
     *  - the creation of a StringBuilder object which does not depend on the length of the list. Therefore it takes Theta(1) time.
     *  - the allocation and assignment of two variables which are constant time operations.
     *  Thus the code before the for-loop will take Theta(1) time to run.
     *
     *  The lines after the for-loop involve a single return instruction and thus take Theta(1) time.
     *
     *  The for-loop itself will iterate over all elements of the DLL. Thus it will perform Theta(N) iterations.
     *  Each iteration will involve:
     *   * The if-conditional will run:
     *       - the if-then-else conditions and branching, which are constant time operations. Thus these cost Theta(1) time.
     *       - The then-branch of the conditional calls StringBuilder's append() method, which (from the Java documentation) we know it runs in Theta(1) time.
     *       - the else-branch of the conditional involves a single assignment, thus runs in Theta(1) time.
     *     Therefore the if-then-else conditions will cost Theta(1) in the worst case.
     *   * The final call to StringBuilder's append will cost again Theta(1)
     *   * the nested call to toString() will cost time proportional to the length of the strings (but not the length of the list). 
     *     Assuming strings are relatively small compared to the size of the list, this cost will be Theta(1).
     *  Therefore each iteration of the loop will cost Theta(1).
     *  Thus the lines involving the for-loop will run in Theta(N)*Theta(1) = Theta(N).
     *
     * Therefore this method will run in Theta(1) + Theta(1) + Theta(N) = Theta(N) time in the worst case.
